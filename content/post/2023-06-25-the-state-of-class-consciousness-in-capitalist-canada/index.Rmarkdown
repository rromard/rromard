Class can be thought of as having both an objective and subjective side. On the objective side, class is a material position in society that reflects one’s relationship to the means of production, a class-in-itself, as it exists in society. On the subjective side is the realm of class consciousness, which can refer to the ideological dimensions of class and how individuals can become aware of their class position in society and act together in shared class interests.

We should resist one-sided and mechanical explanations in general, but especially regarding social class. Even in objective terms, it’s probably not possible to adequately explain it through just one or even a few lenses. We’ll start with how class under capitalism relates to who owns what and how people earn a living, probably the two best starting points for understanding class in a material sense. From there, we’ll assess each of the main social classes in more detail and explore how they relate to each other and the wider economic system.

Finally, there are some areas for more advanced analysis I’m currently considering for the future. Certainly, class is also closely interrelated with identity-based oppression under capitalism. I have written about this in the past, but it’s always worth revisiting. In Canada and countries like it, class has a deep connection to settler-colonialism, especially regarding the construction of whiteness, which has been anathema to the development of working-class consciousness. Last but not least, class under capitalism inherently has international dimensions, to the international nature of both capitalist exploitations, not just of workers, but of the entire world periphery by core nations, and also the ultimate aims of working-class struggle, in the global defeat of capitalism.

The odds are very high that if we ever encounter a mention of class in mainstream Canadian society,  it will likely be in the context of discussions around the "middle class". To a large extent, in the dominant capitalist ideology of class thinking, the middle class is the only class that exists. 

For a long time, the vast majority of people have been ideologically inoculated with the myth of the middle class-- that just about everyone in society is either a member of or should be aspiring to be in the middle class. That something called "middle class values" do or ought to be the prevalent form. As we shall see, this middle-class-centric mode of class thinking is a textbook example of false consciousness, one that obscures the reality of class divisions, by design of course.  

- Canada is probably one of the least class conscious societies in the world.

# The middle class and false consciousness

- Three-Four class model, has a powerful ideological function
- Middle class is key to that functioning
- In popular consciousness: Vaguely economic concept, but also largely vibes based
- Gut level understanding
- Few markers of important factors.

- The conceptual vagueness of middle class is by design per ideology.
- It allows just about anyone to imagine themselves as in the "middle" as a relative position.
- Only a few people are obviously excluded, the very poor and the very rich. Though the latter ought to aspire to be middle class.
- Can show the function with survey data


Across the political spectrum in Canada, which runs from barely centre-left to far-right, empty appeals to the middle class are fodder for all of the major parties and pundits. Canada's nominally social democratic party of labour, the NDP, has all but abandoned working-class politics in favour of hollow pandering to the middle class, which in their view includes some of the top income earners in the country. 

# Historical and current meanings of middle class

- The middle class is a real thing that can be defined and examined.
- Those that live on both labour and capital.
- The reality of it though, is far from it's ideological function.
- Historical: the ruling class of today was once the "middle class" of a prior age.
- Their class perspective is the dominant perspective now, just about everywhere.
- In countries like Canada, middle class consciousness prevails among most.

# The function of middle class in ideology

- Most Canadians understand themselves as middle class people, living in a middle class society, dominated by middle class values.
- This is greatly out of accord with the objective facts of class division in society.
- Engels quote on false consciousness
- https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm
- So it is literally a form of false consciousness, that leads people to incorrect conclusions about the class structure of society and their place within it.

# Class in action

- Some define class largely or solely around income.
- OECD definition of class, middle class.
- Already we can see an important role for this class model, to blot out real class divisions.

- Hide the ruling class, in an "upper class" containing everyone with incomes over $110k.
- At least, an objective, if very flawed measure of class.
- Survey data on how people rate their own class position in society, when asked to think about it.
- There is a well known tendency for more affluent people to under-estimate their own position in the class hierarchy.
- Almost nobody self-identifies as "upper class", regardless of where or how they are asked.
- The "upper" and "upper middle" classes, actually had the same median income.

- Most people feel that they are "middle class" on a gut level.

## Header

- How the question is asked matters, framing.
- Often, people are not given an option to identify as working class.
- The WVS is the most reliable source of survey data, using a 4 class hierarchy that includes the "working" and "lower" classes. 
- They leave it up to respondents to decide what these terms mean to them.
- So the distinctions are not precisely defined, but still, we can learn how many people have at least enough class consciousness to actually see themselves as working class, whatever that means to them.

<div style="min-height:403px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/k1pqq/embed.js?v=1" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/k1pqq/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div><br><br>

- When given the option, most people still don't see themselves as working class.
- Most people see themselves as middle class, mostly "lower-middle", and it is getting worse over time.
- Over the 2000s, the share of people identifying as working class took a steep dive to an all time low.
- Neoliberal ideology, but also the housing bubble probably has a lot to do with it.
- Almost nobody sees themselves as upper class, so few it's like they don't even exist. 
- Accurate at least in that the vast majority of people are not in the ruling class.
- Distinction between the "lower" and working class is also interesting.

- Certainly, those in the lower class are working class people -- proletarians -- that do not see themselves as such. It is again a case of people under-estimating their class position, but to a "lower" class that doesn't quite exist.
- Many of these people may not be working and so not see themselves as working class, but that is not quite a requirement, probably most people that do not work are still working class. Examples: retired workers, unpaid caregivers, many people with disabilities.

## Header - international comparison

- Will show in more detail later, but the objective reality is that the vast majority of people in the world -- even in core countries like Canada -- are working class.
- More than most other countries in the world, Canadian workers have been led to believe that they are "middle class".
- Canada is one of the least class conscious societies on the planet, where almost everyone thinks they are middle class, to the extent that they ever think about class at all, which is rare.
- But the version of the "middle class" -- based to a large degree on gut feeling and vibes -- they think they belong to, does not exist in reality.<br><br>

- Reasons for Canada topping the charts are complicated, will go into more in further detail.
- Settler colonialism, imperialism (labour aristocracy), whiteness and racism, post-war economic anomaly, neoliberal ideology and cultural saturation, dominant political discourse<br><br>

- Like the GSS, we can see that there is some relationship between self-rated class and income, but there is some weird stuff happening.
- Most people (70%) with low incomes rated themselves as either working or lower class.
- Almost all high-income people said they were middle class.

## Header work and class thinking

- So the link between income, often the only indicator of a household's economic situation in these data sets, and self-rated class identity is all over the place. 
- WVS contains a large number of interesting variables to cross with self-rated class identity.
- The links between work and occupation and SRCP are also interesting.

- The relationship between employment status and SRCP: the closer one seems to get to being a full-time employee or having been one, the more likely one is to self-rate as middle class.
- Yet in this case, there was not a middle class consensus across all groups, re: relationship to employment.
- A majority still did identity as middle class, employed workers overwhelmingly so.
- Pausing to note the problematic nature of the category, 'housewife', the groups with the highest levels of working class consciousness were women caregivers, the unemployed, and those in "other" employment situations.<br><br>

- The majority of workers in just about every class of occupation self-rated as middle class.
- Occupation definitely has a more cogent link to self-rated class position.
- Almost all managerial and professional workers saw themselves as middle class.
- Nearly a third of semi-skilled and unskilled workers identified as working class, but still a majority did not.
- Something odd about farming. Farm workers were overwhelmingly middle class, but farm owners/managers were vastly more working class identifying. Small group size maybe?

<div style="min-height:396px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z5F8n/embed.js?v=1" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z5F8n/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div><br><br>

- In 2006, one third of union members saw themselves as working class. A bit higher than the general population.
- By 2020, union members were less likely to identify as workers and more likely to view themselves as middle class than the general population.

## Self rated class and class consciousness

- WVS has some interesting data that provide some subjective indicators of class consciousness.
- First, they had survey respondents rate their political views on a left to right scale.
- Generally, most people are centre-left, with everyone getting a bit more left as self-rated class declines.
- Most people have been shifting a bit to the left over time as well.
- The "lower" class had the most far left people, whatever that means to them. 
- The middle class actually had more people on the left (4 and under) than the working class, 30% to 25%. Though the working class's centre-left share was much bigger.
- The upper class is all over the place, probably because very few people ever identify as upper class, so small changes in response patterns can produce big relative differnces. That said, rich people were very right ring in 2020. Sounds about right.<br><br>

<div style="min-height:635px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rMgY5/embed.js?v=1" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rMgY5/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div><br><br>

- This one is interesting. One of the strongest subjective factors in middle class ideology is the belief in a meritocratic society, that the affluent are those that have worked hard for their success. It follows then, that one could move up even higher on the ideological class ladder, if one just puts in a bit more elbow grease. 
- Both middle and working class people were the most likely to believe that hard work is the key to success.
- The least likely to believe so? The self-identified upper class, a plurality of whom said that their success was mostly a matter of being connected and lucky (ie, being born into wealth).<br><br>
