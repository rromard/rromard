Test posts are really great, everyone loves them.

Maybe in _my_ post I will __do__ some R chunks

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

plotto <- ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, 
                   y = circumference, 
                   colour = Tree)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  guides(colour = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()

plotto
```
