Capitalist exploitation might begin in the workplace, but it certainly
does not end there. If capitalism is the society of generalized
commodity production -- where everything increasingly exists as a
commodity to be bought and sold -- then it is also the society of
generalized exploitation, which increasingly pervades every corner of
society. If exploitation can also happen outside of the workplace, any
measure of class should try to take this into account.

Our [previous
analysis](https://ds4cs.netlify.app/post/unmasking-exploitation-with-the-monetary-equivalent-of-labour-time/)
used employment data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in combination
with the monetary equivalent of labour time (MELT)[^1] to measure the
degree of exploitation in paid employment. This time around, we'll use
data from the Canadian Income Survey to do a similar analysis, but using
a fuller concept of income.

[^1]: The MELT is the ratio that expresses how much monetary value an
    hour of labour adds to production and is calculated by dividing net
    national income by the total number of hours worked in an economy.
    That means that in 2021, an average hour of labour in Canada created
    just under \$70 in monetary value, while the average worker received
    only about 45% of that value back in the form of wages.

In practice, people have many sources of income beyond paid employment.
In particular, income from property ownership, crucial to understanding
the economic dimensions of social class, has not yet been accounted for.
To move forward, a more holistic concept of income is needed -- one that
can account for the fact that some people are able to reap surplus value
through market exchange, while other people lose value through it.

## Circulation and exchange are central to exploitation

Exploitation, at least in the first instance, is something that happens
in the realm of production, where economic value is created. Surplus
value, the raw material of profit, can only ever be created by
exploitation of workers through the wage labour relationship. As workers
are compelled to perform surplus labour, producing goods and services
for the capitalist class, those commodities can be sold for a greater
sum of money than the cost of production.

For that surplus of value to be enjoyed by the owners of capital though,
it has to be converted into a sum of money through sales, *i.e.* market
exchange. Once in money form, as we all know, value can move freely in
the *realm of circulation*, moving from one person, account, region or
even country to another with ease. If the essence of exploitation is
acquiring value created by the work done by others, then market exchange
and circulation are essential to the process.

Once realized in the form of revenue, the proceeds of exploitation
circulate into the hands of the owners of capital, commonly through
payment of shareholder dividends -- a mechanism for the upward
redistribution of surplus value produced by workers to capital owners
throughout the world. Shareholders are also compensated for their
investments indirectly, by the rising value of their business assets,
which they can cash in by way of capital gains, meaning profit from the
sale of assets or property that have increased in market value.

Circulation isn't just a way of redistributing profits created by
labour. It is also possible for exploitation to happen through market
exchange. We tend to assume that most exchanges in a market economy are
done fairly -- that in general, most of the time, buyers get what they
pay for and sellers receive fair value in return.

Yet in reality, unfair and unequal exchange happens all the time, where
one party in the buyer-seller relationship gains value at the expense of
the other party. **No new value can ever be created by this
exchange-based (or rent-seeking) form of exploitation**, which is
premised mainly on plucking already-produced value from the pockets of
others. Here are a few examples of how this happens:

-   **Rent seeking:** Extraction of rent from tenants by landlords for
    example, who capitalize their property, which includes land itself,
    by eating a share of the income of both residential and commercial
    tenants.

-   **Ripping off consumers:** Many forms of corporate, financial and
    regulatory crimes are a roundabout form of [exploitation through
    market
    exchange](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/57E2585EBDEB7CAE22332A3DA75EE0BD/S0261387522000022a.pdf/taking_market_crime_seriously.pdf),
    involving the reaping of extra value in exchange using deception,
    fraud, and other forms of capitalist malfeasance.

-   **Financial exploitation:** Exploitation of [debtors by
    creditors](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0486613417707530),
    as owners of financial capital (think wealthy shareholders in banks,
    insurance companies, investment funds, and other financial sectors)
    squeeze value from working class people, smaller capitalists, and
    even entire countries, mostly in the form of interest payments.

-   **Imperialism and colonialism:** Unequal exchange is the norm on an
    international scale, where nations in the imperialist core (like
    Canada, the USA, most of Europe) benefit from value extracted from
    nations in the exploited Majority World or so-called Global South.
    Estimates vary greatly, but a significant portion of national income
    in countries like Canada come from such sources.

The reverse implication is that one may also be exploited in any of the
ways above. So you are not only exploited by your boss, in that he
pockets the surplus value you produce at work, but also by your
landlord, the bank that owns your mortgage, your credit card company,
and maybe even colluding grocery monopolists.

## Introducing the concept of market income

Using a fuller concept of income, we can gauge exploitation based on the
value of the total income received, instead of employment earnings
alone. What is needed is an income concept that accounts for the fact
that people can either gain or lose value through both market exchange
and other forms of transfers.

Thankfully, this concept already exists and is commonly known as
***Market Income***. Sometimes called *income before taxes and
transfers*, market income is a measure of total income, before
government transfers are accounted for and taxes are deducted, which
includes:

-   Employment compensation, like wages and salaries;

-   Net self-employment or professional income;

-   Private pension income;

-   Investment income, like dividends or rental fees, but not capital
    gains;

-   Other miscellaneous sources like scholarships or certain retirement
    allowances.

For this analysis, we are only including people in the labour force that
have worked at least 150 hours and have positive income in 2021. Those
whose main source of income is either pensions or government transfers
are excluded.

An important initial finding was that some people take in more value
than they produce, not because they are exploiters, but because they are
respectively, either (1) semi-retired and work very little, living
mostly on savings or public pension payments; or (2) work very little
and survive on punitively meager public transfers like social assistance
or disability payments.

So there are other contextual factors to consider with regard to the
value of income and class position. At this point, we are also not
considering the impact of the tax system, which is another method of
redistributing surplus value throughout society. Considering taxes would
change the picture somewhat, but it would probably not be a drastic
difference.

## Measuring exploitation with the Canadian Income Survey

To account for many sources of income using real world data, we can turn
to the public-use microdata file (PUMF) of the Canadian Income Survey
(CIS), one of the main sources of data on the incomes of individuals and
households in Canada. Switching over to the CIS, we gain more detailed
information on all of the possible sources of income, as well as
potential transfers of value like taxes or social welfare payments. In
return, we lose out on knowing which industry people are employed in and
what their occupation is.

Multiplying the number of hours worked in the year by the monetary
equivalent of labour time (MELT) of \$64.75 an hour, we can make an
estimate of how much value a person could have added with their labour
in 2021.[^2] The MELT is the ratio that expresses how much monetary
value an hour of labour adds to production and is calculated by dividing
net national income by the total number of hours worked in an economy.

[^2]: Here we are making the assumption that all employed people are
    producing value when they are doing socially necessary labour in the
    process of production. Though there has been considerable debate on
    this topic, in practice, it's likely that not all labour is value
    productive. So many of the top earners, who tend to be much engaged
    in much more managerial labour and are employed much more so in
    financial and speculative industries, are probably not even
    producing at all. So their very high incomes might be technically
    counted as "employment income" in official statistics, but are made
    up entirely surplus value produced by workers. But that's a
    complicated analysis to pull off using real world data, hence the
    simplifying assumption.

That means that in 2021, an average hour of labour in Canada created
just under \$70 in monetary value. An average work year of 1,601 hours
would have produced about \$109,000 in monetary value -- the vast
majority of people had incomes far below that mark.

`Value added = Total hours worked * MELT`

Dividing that labour value added by market income yields the **value of
market income** or just income value for short. This ratio expresses how
much value is captured in total income relative to how much value is
added by labour time.

<br>

A person getting total income worth half of the value they created as a
worker would have an income value of 50%. An income value of 100%
indicates that a person is receiving the entire value of their labour,
while a value of 200% indicates getting twice the value of their work
back, and so on.

`Income value = Market income / Value added`

In the table below, the employed population of Canada (with a few minor
exceptions) has been divided into groups based on the value of their
market income. In terms of income value, the vast majority of people in
the labour force face similar circumstances.

The bottom 40% in terms of income value -- about 6.9 million people, the
workers with the lowest wages in the country -- were getting on average
well under one-third of the value of their labour back in market income.
The middle 40% on top of them -- another 6.9 million people with
average, but still modest incomes -- were doing only marginally better
with average incomes worth less than 60% of the value of their labour.

Only when reaching into the top 15 percent of the income value
distribution do we see income begin to approach 100% of value added,
meaning people are getting back the full value of an hour of labour in
wages. Those in the top 1% of income "earners" had an average market
income worth nearly five times the value potentially added by their
labour, while the top 0.1% had incomes more than twelve times as
valuable.

<div style="min-height:436px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4Vdqu/embed.js?v=7" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4Vdqu/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<br>

Below is another way of looking at the distribution of income values.
This time, people are grouped by the income value range they fall into
instead of quantile groups. The vast majority (87.6%) of people in the
labour force who worked over 150 hours (15.1 million people) had an
income value of under 100%. These people could be considered members of
the exploited class(es), meaning their wages were worth less than the
value added by their labour -- and that *surplus of value was pocketed
by somebody else*.

More than 9 million of those people, with average incomes in the range
of \$45K and below, were receiving wages worth much less than half of
the value they created. There is -- I suspect -- some meaningful
distinction, to look into later on, among the exploited workers at
around the 75% income value mark, especially in the upper reaches of
that range, where workers are still exploited, but have higher incomes
and probably a higher material standard of living.

Just over 2.1 million people -- a little over 12% of the labour force --
had an income value of 100% or higher.[^3] In economic terms, these
people are members of the exploiting class(es), in that they are getting
back income worth more than they could have added with their work. It is
a a small minority of people, but still far more than the previous
estimate of around 500K people based on employment data from the Labour
Force Survey.

[^3]: If we remove the restriction of 150 working hours, that figure
    rises slightly to about 2.3 million.

<div style="min-height:413px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/P0vtk/embed.js?v=6" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/P0vtk/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

## Double dipping into surplus value

How are people taking in more value than they produce with their work?
We can break down market income into it's various components to shed
some light on where they are getting that money from. The next chart
displays the average values of many sources of income across the range
of income values.

People with overvalued total incomes tend to have very high employment
compensation. In fact, about two-thirds of exploiters surpass an income
value of 100% based on their employment compensation alone.[^4] No
doubt, many of these people are the [highly paid professionals,
specialists and
managers](https://ds4cs.netlify.app/post/unmasking-exploitation-with-the-monetary-equivalent-of-labour-time/)
highlighted in the previous analysis. This is the initial dip into
societal surplus value -- as at least part of the employment
compensation of exploiters must actually be value produced by other
exploited workers.

[^4]: Only about 3% of paid employees had wages worth 100% of value in
    the LFS. One major reason this figure is so much higher is that the
    CIS treats some of the "labour compensation" of owners of
    incorporated businesses (their salaries, not dividend income from
    shares) as wages and salaries. In practice, some of that income
    might be genuine labour compensation, while another portion of it
    will be returns to owned capital.

Investment income is the second dip into societal surplus value, which
is produced by exploiting workers and then redistributed to the owners
of capital by way of shareholder dividends, rental income, investment
trust payments, and interest payments on things like bonds, loans,
mortgages, or savings. There is a massive chasm of investment income
separating people on either side of the exploitation line. Just 16% of
people with income values below 100% receive any non-trivial (over
\$100) investment income at all, compared to 42% of exploiters.

Even then, the vast majority of small-time investors do not make serious
money on investments. One needs to have money to make money, as it goes.
To make a monthly income of just \$1,000 in passive income, one would
have to have about [\$180-200K invested in average return
stocks](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/passive-income-much-invest-earn-014500818.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN0BQre-8o6U3UcGUxui2hEbNein44tE7Yb_0W27r4qR7Z-WaMl4yFks8M2kkY7rneBNEH-kFglFSMiQnZSyCoJZunN9daULO2vKwyiH-BS_57Yo_vnqmfAI0sBQfkmz8wJ5yMxUt9zdGISy-NqBQg498423rRIspuB7dElr4Hws#:~:text=The%20Motley%20Fool-,Passive%20Income%3A%20How%20Much%20Should%20You,to%20Earn%20%241%2C000%20Every%20Month%3F&text=Investing%20in%20high%2Dyielding%20dividend,a%20monthly%20income%20of%20%241%2C000.)
that pay monthly dividends. It is very common for small-time investors
to merely break even and they can easily lose small amounts of money
rather than make gains.

<div style="min-height:409px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iKXLB/embed.js?v=3" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iKXLB/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<br>

Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets that have appreciated
in value. If you buy a house for \$500,000 and sell it for \$600,000,
you have enjoyed a capital gain of \$100,000. The vast majority of
people, owning no valuable investment assets other than (perhaps) a
home, report little to no capital gains over the course of an entire
lifetime.

Capital gains are so uncommon for most people, in fact, that they are
not included in conventional measures of income -- so they are **extra**
income added on top of market income. Yet, regular capital gains are key
to the incomes of those with very high incomes, who can afford to own
valuable assets to sell in the first place and do so frequently. The
higher income rises, all the way to the very top capitalists, the more
important capital gains are as a source of regular income.

In the chart below, the distribution of total income between the
exploited and exploiter classes is shown. The share of income from
investment and capital gains diverted to exploiters is hard to
understate. About one-eighth (12.4%) of people in the labour force took
in well over half of all investment income (\$31.6B) and capital gains
(\$25.6B) in 2021. Notably, they also received nearly half of
self-employment income, despite only representing only 16% of
self-employed people that year.

## The commanding heights of income value

Our analysis has an important limitation with regard to the class
structure of society. Since we are using a public-use microdata file
(PUMF), it has been altered in many ways by Statistics Canada to protect
the privacy of respondents. This is most impactful at the very top of
the income distribution, where there are very few people with very high
incomes -- so much of the very top incomes in the country are capped at
a lower value or have been scrubbed from the data entirely.

Consequently, the CIS can be used to produce solid estimates of incomes
of the vast majority of people in Canada, but it underestimates the very
highest incomes in the country by a significant degree. Thankfully,
Statistics Canada does release income estimates for those with very high
incomes based on administrative tax filing data.

Based on tax filing data, the top 1% had market income of \$567K, which
is about twice as high as the top-coded estimates from the CIS. Those in
the top 0.01% of the income distribution -- under three thousand people
in total -- had market incomes three and a half times higher than the
rest of the top 1% and over 700 times higher than those in the bottom
50% of incomes. When capital gains are included, the total incomes of
the top 0.01% represented **over 114 times more value** than an average
year of work created.

<div style="min-height:348px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eJpnf/embed.js?v=4" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eJpnf/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<br>

Recall from the last post that the MELT can be used to express amounts
of value in either money or units of socially necessary labour time. The
inverse of the melt `(1 / MELT)`, often called the **value of money**,
expresses how much social labour time each dollar represents. In 2021,
the value of money was such that each dollar represented about *52
seconds of socially necessary labour time*.

In terms of labour value, the average person in the top 0.01% had
incomes worth over 182 thousand hours of social labour time. If a person
worked an average of 1,650 hours a year over the course of 40 years,
they would clock in about 66,000 hours of labour before retirement. So
those at the very top of the income distribution took in nearly **three
lifetimes worth of labour value** as annual income. For the first time
in this analysis, we are getting a glimpse of the true capitalist ruling
class of the country.

## The story so far

Here's the picture so far, then. If the mark of belonging to the
exploiter class(es) is getting out more value than one contributes, then
about 13% of people in the labour force, numbering about 2.3 million,
could be counted as such -- over 4.2 times as many people than using an
estimate based only on employment income from the LFS. At this point,
there are two major considerations.

*First*, is that we have not accounted for the role of the tax system
and other transfers of value in the class structure of Canadian society.
The tax system is one of the main methods of redistributing income and
value throughout society. When we account for taxes, this picture will
change somewhat, though it is hard to say by how much.

Further to that, we should consider exploitative transfers of value like
extraction of rent. Should the rent you are forced to pay your landlord
-- a part of your income that becomes the capital and profit of someone
else -- be counted as part of the value of your income? Probably not!

*Second*, is that income and wealth are two sides of the same coin. Any
consideration of income in this instance is incomplete without
considering wealth and vice versa. People with exploiter-range incomes
captured the majority of investment and capital gains income, despite
only being about one-eight of the employed population.

To get a fuller view of the class structure of society therefore, we
need to look into where that passive income is coming from. Passive
income necessarily flows from owned assets, property with economic value
that can be accumulated over time. It will be necessary therefore to
look not just at class-based exploitation related to income, but also
how it is tied to the accumulation of household wealth.
