If your boss makes a dollar, you make a dime. That's why you analyze the
links between social class and exploitation on company time. Rather than
treating objective social class as some function of income, education,
and occupation, we're going to begin with capitalist exploitation in the
workplace, then build out from there. Drawing on the labor theory of
value, we'll establish how much value each hour of labour adds to the
overall production -- the Monetary Equivalent of Labour Time -- and use
that as a basis for measuring exploitation.

Using data on employment from the Labour Force Survey, we can compare
the average wage to the value of labor time to assess the degree of
exploitation experienced by workers. In short, for every dollar in value
added to the net product by an hour of labour, the average worker in
Canada receives only a fraction of value back, about 45 cents in wages.

I am hopeful that this approach can be refined over time, using real
world data, to provide an alternative view of the class structure and
dynamics within capitalist societies, focusing on the central role of
labor exploitation in creating class divisions. If you want more
information on the assumptions this analysis uses, please see the
[**notes in the appendix**](#appendix).

### Exploitation is the foundation of class inequality

To paraphrase Marx's famous axiom, the two original sources of all
wealth are labour and the natural world. Capitalist exploitation centers
on extraction of **economic value** created the labour of the working
class in the process of producing commodities, *i.e.* goods and services
for sale. Simply put, economic value (*a.k.a.* exchange-value) is a
measure of the worth of a commodity relative to other commodities. Why
does a car cost so much more than a roll of paper towel? Of course, it
is because a car is a much more valuable commodity. Why is a car more
valued, in that case? According to Marxian theories of value, economic
value can only be added to commodities by the expenditure of [socially
necessary labour
time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_necessary_labour_time)
(SNLT). Commodities that require more SNLT to produce have an
accordingly higher value, so a car is more valued because it takes that
much more work by society to make them -- not just in the assembly, but
also the past work done to mine and refine metals, manufacture parts,
and so on.

Under capitalism, exploitation begins in the workplace, through the
employer-employee relationship.[^1] In prior societies, the ruling
classes relied on people like bailiffs and knights to compel peasants,
with force if needed, to do surplus labour in order to pay taxes and
tribute. The capitalist has no need to be so direct. Capitalism is the
society of generalized commodity production. That means just about
everything you need to survive, let alone enjoy life, exists only as a
commodity for sale. Lacking any capital of your own (*because it is
concentrated in very few hands*) and the means of being self-sufficient
(*because it is often outlawed*), you have no choice but to sell your
**labour-power** (the capacity to work) for a wage to buy the means of
living.

[^1]: Of course, exploitation takes many forms under modern capitalism.
    So here were are concerned with the production of surplus value for
    the ruling class, which we can consider the primary form of
    exploitation. Since surplus value can change hands in exchange, it's
    possible for exploitation to happen in many ways. For example, the
    exploitation of debtors by creditors, tenants by landlords, or
    winners in an process of unequal exchange.

Since the capitalist owns the capital, they have great, often
unilateral, power to set the legal terms of employment, to discipline
workers into producing a surplus for the owning class. The essence of
capitalist exploitation is thus -- the boss pays for your labour-power
with wages, but because they own the capital, receives the added value
created by your labour, embodied (not physically, but in the [price of
production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prices_of_production)) in the
goods or services you worked to produce. How would a person know if they
are exploited at work? How can we measure this exploitation?

Here is a simple example. Assume a worker works an eight hour shift for
a wage of \$15 an hour. They produce goods with a sale price of \$40 and
fixed costs like raw materials and utilities of \$30 per unit, yielding
a surplus of \$10 per sale. Producing 5 units in an hour, that worker
has done enough **necessary labour** to cover their own wages (\$120) in
under three hours. Of course, they don't get to call it a day at that
point, according to the terms of their contract, they must work the rest
of the shift doing **surplus labour**. In eight hours, they produce 40
units that can be sold for \$1600, which after deducting fixed costs
like raw materials and utilities (\$1200) and the daily wage (\$120),
yields of surplus of \$280, which works out to \$35 per hour.

<br>

Where does this miraculous surplus of money come from? The source is the
value added to commodities by the expenditure of labour-power. This
difference between wages (the value of labour-power) and the value of
the final products is referred to **surplus value**, out of which profit
is taken, shareholder dividends are paid, taxes are extracted, and wages
of people like supervisory workers are covered.

### The connection between money and labour time

One of the [most important
innovations](http://beneweb.com.br/resources/Teoria_do_valor/Labor%20theory%20of%20value%20Foley.pdf)
in the study of capitalism in recent decades has been the revival and
refinement of a concept used by Marx to describe the relationship
between money and human labour time. This tool is now aptly known as the
**Monetary Equivalent of Labour Time** or MELT for short. The MELT is
calculated[^2] by simply dividing the total number of hours worked in an
economy by the total net product of labour in money form. It is
therefore a ratio that expresses the monetary value added by each hour
of living labour performed in a capitalist economy.

[^2]: Two different schools of Marxist economists have worked on two
    different approaches to how to calculate the MELT, which boils down
    to debates between proponents of the so-called "New Interpretation"
    versus those advocating a temporal single system (or TSSI) approach,
    that considers the forward progression of time in economic
    calculations. For the sake of convenience, I'm using the MELT
    calculation done by those in the NI tradition, which is annual net
    product over working hours. They have really gone at it in terms of
    debate over the years, but I'm not so sure it matters all that much
    for this analysis in the end.

Value can be expressed in both hours of social labour and sums of money
(*a.k.a.* prices), since value is both of those things at once. Human
labour time is the substance of value, meaning units of SNLT are the
basic building blocks of value that determine it's magnitude.

Money is the form of appearance that value takes in reality -- it is
objectified social labour time. When we go shopping, we can't see all of
the labour done, past and present, to make the commodity, we only see
the price expressed in money. But commodities with higher values, in
general, tend to have higher prices, and vice versa, so the price we pay
is innately tied to value. Yet value can only be realized, made material
in the real world, if converted into money via sales. If goods go
unsold, value can go unrealized and even be wasted. So there is a hidden
inner relationship, happening out of sight, between social labour time
and money as interrelated (and sometimes contradictory) aspects of
value.

Using the MELT it is possible to [convert amounts of economic value into
either labour time or
money,](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Economics/Principles_of_Political_Economy_-_A_Pluralistic_Approach_to_Economic_Theory_(Saros)/01%3A_An_Introduction_to_Economic_Theory/04%3A_The_Marxian_Theory_of_Class_Exploitation)
and to transition between either of those forms smoothly, as Marx does
time and time again in his writings. In the one-worker example above,
the net product, the money left over after fixed costs, but not wages,
are deducted, works out to \$400 in eight hours of work. That implies a
MELT of \$50, which is the amount of money value added by each hour of
work. Conversely, each dollar represents about one minute and twelve
seconds of socially necessary labour time, a measure sometimes called
the *value of money*, the inverse of the MELT.

### The value of an hour's work in capitalist Canada

Recall that surplus value, the raw material of profit, is what remains
after the worker's share is deducted from the total product. In order to
measure exploitation therefore, the **value of labour-power** (VLP)
needs to be established. In the traditional school of thought, the VLP
is defined by the value of the consumption goods that workers buy to
live. There are many complications in making such calculations using
real world data. Other scholars of capitalism have, more recently,
defined the value of labour-power as the [ratio of the money wage to the
MELT](http://digamo.free.fr/dongmin9.pdf). Using the MELT therefore, we
can measure how much value workers receive in wages relative to the
monetary value they create with each hour of their labour in terms of
either money or labour hours.

To compute the MELT for Canada, we can divide **net national income** by
the total number of **hours worked at all jobs**, sourcing data from the
country's national and industrial accounts respectively. In 2022,
Canada's net national income was about \$2.3 trillion, while Canadian
workers put in about 33.6 billion hours in at their workplaces. That
works out to a monetary equivalent of labour time of **\$69 per hour
worked**. In other words, each hour of socially necessary labour done in
Canada adds \$69 worth of economic value to goods and services.

Given an average hourly wage of \$36.20 in 2022, the value of labour
power for an average hour of work was little over half (52%) of the
monetary value created. In my reading of the literature, the MELT and
MELT-derived VLP have been used extensively for macroeconomic analysis.
I believe that there is potential to use these tools on other data
sources to build objective indicators of exploitation in the study of
the class structure of capitalism. Other than a few [introductory blog
posts by this
author](https://medium.com/@re.Marx/you-create-78-of-value-with-each-hour-of-labor-130f8100304d),
I don't think this kind of analysis has really been attempted yet, so
from here on the work is going to be largely exploratory and a bit
experimental.

<div style="min-height:336px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qd3H1/embed.js?v=1" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qd3H1/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

### Very few employees paid more than the value of labour time

So, where do we begin this exploration? It makes sense to me to start in
the workplace, the hearth of capitalist exploitation, and build out the
analysis from there. One possible point of departure is to ask who
receives wages worth less than the monetary value produced by an average
hour of labour? Those that are exploited will by definition get back
less value in wages than the monetary value created by an hour of labour
time -- **their VLP will be less than 100%** and probably much less.

Conversely, we could ask who gets paid more than the money value of
labour time? If such people exist, they would not be exploited, but an
exploiter group, in the sense that their employment income would
represent more value than the value of average labour time. For such
individuals, the **VLP will be 100% or higher**. This would leave us
with a binary measure of exploitation based on the value of labour
power, defined as their hourly wage against the MELT, where those below
100% are exploited and those above are not exploited (at least in value
terms).

Using data on employment and wages from the Labour Force Survey (LFS),
we can see that the vast majority of workers (97%) have employment
earnings worth less than the monetary value produced by their labour.
Only about 3% of people in the labour force -- a half-million
individuals, give or take -- are "over-valued" employees, meaning they
are earning the full money value of an average hour's work or more
through paid employment. Note that because the LFS does not contain
income data for the self-employed, all figures from here on refer to
paid employees only, an important limitation of this data, as we shall
see.

<div style="min-height:390px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/C8V8t/embed.js?v=2" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/C8V8t/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<br>

So nearly everyone is paid much less than the value created by an hour
of labour. Of course, this is entirely expected, if it were not so, then
either capitalism has broken down or ceased being capitalism altogether.
Clearly, this binary measure of exploitation is going to be of limited
use. We are going to need more detailed information to form a clear view
of the structure of class in Canada. But let's stick with the binary
measure for a little while longer to see if it offers any further
insights.

### Who are the "over-valued" workers? Managers and professionals.

Just who are the lucky 3% that somehow manage to get paid more than the
average value of labour? Again, we can use data from the LFS to dig a
little deeper. The answer, in short, is professionals and managers,
especially in senior and specialized management occupations. Managers
were about 7% of the workforce in 2022, but nearly half (45%) of
employees that were paid more than the monetary value of labour time.
They are joined by a very small minority of professional employees in
fields like business, science, and education. Notably, even among
managers and professionals, a majority of employees still had hourly pay
below the monetary value of labour time.

Specialized middle managers (147K employees) and professionals in the
natural and applied sciences (108K employees) are the most numerous
among the "over-valued" employees, accounting for just under half of
them (49%). The remaining half is filled out with other middle (67K) and
senior (20K) managers and smaller groupings of professionals in the
fields of business (54K), education (38K), and legal or
social/government services (37.8K), then much smaller clusters spread
across the remaining occupations.

<div style="min-height:796px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/B4Hp4/embed.js?v=4" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/B4Hp4/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<br>

A noticeable absence stands out in this data -- where are all of the
highly paid professionals? While professionals were among the most
likely to have a VLP of 100% or greater, the LFS data shows that it is
only a very small minority that do so. One explanation is simply that
information is obscured the level of aggregation of the LFS occupational
data. For example, lawyers and judges are grouped into the broad
category of "occupations in law and social, community, and government
services." In this broad occupational grouping, legal professionals form
a very small minority, about 108K people out of a workforce of 2.2M in
2022, about 4.8% of the total. No doubt, if we could separate out legal
professionals from the big group, we would see a very high share of
people being paid more than the monetary value of labour time.

Another important reason for the low rates observed among professionals
is that the LFS does not capture the income of self-employed people.
Many highly paid professionals in fields like law or medicine earn most,
if not all, of their income through self-employment, rather than as paid
employees. Take doctors, for example, who have one of the highest rates
of self-employment of any occupation in Canada. Under Canada's health
care system, the majority of doctors work for themselves, even if they
labour in public health care settings like hospitals.

Doctors make most of their income (about three quarters) by billing the
public health system for services rendered, not as salaried employees.
In 2021-22, the average doctor [billed \$325,000 to the
public](https://www.cihi.ca/en/a-profile-of-physicians-in-canada). If
the average overhead (e.g., paying staff, medical supplies) for
operating a practice is about 25% that works out to an annual net income
of \$243,7500 for an average physician. In tax terms, this is referred
to as 'net professional income' which is an important source of income
for many of the top income earners in the country.

While few physicians appear to be paid over the MELT in their capacity
as paid employees, many supplement their self-employment income with
high paying teaching or research work in academic settings. To get a
full picture, we'll have to find another source of data that has
information on the incomes of self-employed people.

### Exploitation as a gradient, rather than a binary

Using a binary measure of exploitation shows a tremendous gap in wages
between those on either side of the MELT. Compared to the vast majority
of workers in their respective industries, average hourly earnings for
the supervisory and professional employees with wages over the MELT are
200% to 300% higher. Here we are talking about the top tier of income
"earners" below the corporate executive level.[^3]

[^3]: Here I am using the term "earn" in a technical sense, that the
    very high incomes are earned rightly according to bourgeois legal
    rights, not saying that they have done anything to "deserve" being
    paid more than the value anybody's labour creates.

But what else can we say based on this? Looks like we are missing a lot
of information in that wage chasm. I don't think at this point, we can
say 97% of people are objectively working class, because they get back
less than the value of their labour at work, and call it a day. Instead
of an all or nothing measure, it is probably more fruitful to consider a
**gradient of exploitation**, based on the value of labour power as a
share of the money value produced by socially necessary labour time.

<div style="min-height:530px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/k2ZPV/embed.js?v=1" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/k2ZPV/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<br>

Below is such a view of exploitation as a spectrum, rather than a
binary, based on deciles of hourly employment earnings earnings. When
considering an objective marker of class position based on exploitation,
it's not so much whether a person receives **more or less** in wages
than the monetary value created by their labour, because nearly everyone
gets less, but **how much** of that value they are able to retain as
income.

Broken down this way, we can see that 90% of employed workers are paid
hourly wages worth **at most** two-thirds (66%) of the money value of
labour time. Workers in the bottom 50% of the earnings distribution took
home even less, no more than 40% of the money value added by their
labour. Even those in the top 10% of income earners took home on
average, close to (92%), but still less than the full money value of an
hour's work.

<div style="min-height:523px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/z989C/embed.js?v=2" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/z989C/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<br>

Here is another view using the continuous measure of exploitation,
broken down by some demographic variables. All factors that we already
know relate to income inequality, like age, gender, race, or education,
will similarly impact the value of labour power.

The average worker overall received wages worth about 45% of the MELT.
Employees with a high school education, part-time and temporary
employees, and those in non-managerial and non-professional jobs, had
wages valued 30% to 40% of the MELT. At the other end of the scale,
those with university educations and professional occupations were paid
about 55 to 60% of the MELT, while only senior managers came close to
the full value at 91% of the MELT.

<div style="min-height:647px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ECpEb/embed.js?v=2" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ECpEb/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<br>

At this point, we have to stop, lest we conclude that the ruling class
is actually comprised of managers and professionals, as some have
erroneously done -- at some point, I might address the "PMC" thesis, but
not today. Clearly, we will need more information. We haven't yet
addressed the flip side of this exploitation based analysis, namely the
ownership side. If the value of the labour power of the average worker
is 45%, where is the rest of that value going? For the most part, it is
going to those who own the capital.

Income from ownership of capital will have to be accounted for, meaning
we will need to look beyond the bounds of paid employment to examine the
class dimensions of exploitation. Using the LFS, we can only consider
income from paid employment. Yet in reality, there are many potential
sources of income, like government transfers, self-employment,
dividends, capital gains, and rents.

Next up, we will integrate another data source, the Canadian Income
Survey, that contains more detailed information on incomes in Canada.
Doing so, we can also broaden the horizons of the concept of
exploitation a bit, to show how it can also take place outside of the
workplace, as surplus value changes hands in the realm of market
exchange.

## Appendix

### Technical assumptions

1.  **Aggregate vs. Industry level:** The MELT is calculated and holds
    at the aggregate level of the entire economy, representing the money
    value added by an hour of human labour time that is average in
    character (e.g., complexity, skill, intensity, productivity). We are
    assuming, at the macro level, that concrete hours worked at all jobs
    is equal to the total number of socially necessary abstract labour
    hours worked. This assumption holds in the aggregate, though
    possibly not at the industry level. It is possible to calculate a
    MELT specific to each industry, but things behave a bit differently
    on the micro level, so for now we'll put that to the side.

2.  **Productive vs. unproductive labour:** That all labour is
    productive of surplus value, even though this is probably not the
    case. Some authors have indeed argued that [all labour is productive
    of
    value](https://thecommoner.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/David-Harvie-All-Labour-is-Productive-and-Unproductive.pdf).
    It's also an assumption commonly taken just for the purpose of
    methodological simplification. But it is also possible to use data
    to make a [distinction
    between](https://www.umass.edu/economics/publications/2018-15.pdf)
    "productive" and "unproductive" labour -- technical, not moral
    categories -- based on whether it produces a return to capital or
    not. I plan on introducing this concept later down the road, since
    there is so much baggage to unpack with these concepts.

3.  **Nearly anyone can be exploited:** Leading from the last point, is
    that workers can be exploited even if they do "unproductive" labour,
    because the essence of class exploitation is not strictly limited to
    the production of surplus value. Across all modes of production, not
    just capitalism, the core of exploitation is the compulsion of the
    working classes to perform surplus labour for property owners. To
    the extent that all workers under capitalism labour under the
    disciplinary [compulsion to perform surplus
    labour](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/goughi/Gough%20NLR%2076.pdf),
    they can be (potentially) exploited.

4.  **Equal rate of exploitation:** That all workers [produce the same
    amount of value](https://repec.umb.edu/RePEc/files/2021_01.pdf) with
    their work, regardless of the industry they work in, the
    productivity of their labour, or their level of education, training,
    and skill. Some scholars have argued that this is how [capital works
    in practice](http://onala.free.fr/choonara18.pdf). Other have argued
    that below the macro level, [workers do produce different amounts of
    value](http://digamo.free.fr/rieu2008.pdf), depending on the
    productivity and complexity of that labour. Sounds complicated. For
    now, we will be treating an average hour's work is worth an average
    hour's work, no more or less.

5.  **International dimension of exploitation:** That we are only
    considering the Canadian economy in isolation. In practice, this is
    clearly not the case in the age of global supply chains. It is well
    known that surplus value is transmitted even [between countries via
    unequal
    exchange](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2019/11/14/hm2-the-economics-of-modern-imperialism/),
    specifically enacting a transfer of value from exploited nations to
    those in the rich imperial core. So the picture of exploitation in
    Canada will look differently through an international lens, though
    by how much it is hard to say. I'm hoping to be able to address this
    at some point, but it would require a lot of work.
