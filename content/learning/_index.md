One of the long term goals for this site is to offer free learning resources on data science for the Left.
The world is awash in massive amounts of introductory content on the basics of data science, data analytics, 
and coding. My goal is to avoid duplicating much of that content by focusing on those topics from the perspective
of the socialist activist, curious about how to begin using data to boost their communications and practice. 
Some of the topics covered will likely include:

- Developing plans for the strategic and secure use of data 
- How to find and prepare relevant data
- Practical data analysis for socialists
- Data visualization and data-driven storytelling
- Basic aspects of coding, statistics, and data science
