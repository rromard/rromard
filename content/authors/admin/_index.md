My academic training is in political science and sociology and I have been
working as a researcher and data specialist in the public sector for several 
years. **Data Science for Class Struggle** is my personal website, serving as an
outlet for my independent analysis, writing, data visualizations, and infographics.
My personal work is informed by Marxist approaches to sociology and political 
economy and as such, takes a highly opinionated stand against all forms of exploitation 
and oppression. All analysis and views are strictly my own, unless indicated
otherwise.

My data science learning journey, ongoing since 2018, is still in the 
early days and I would describe myself as an intermediate programmer at best. I
still have so much to learn about data science, so I am hoping that this site
will serve as an educational resource, both in my own learning and also for others
on the left. If you or your organization(s) are curious about incorporating 
data science and social scientific research methods your theory and practices,
feel free to get in touch with me using the contact form below.
